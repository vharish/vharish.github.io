	<p>
		Hello! I'm Harish, a software engineer with a deep interest in building scalable web applications and elegant user interfaces. 
		My journey in technology began with a curiosity for how things work on the web, which evolved into a professional career 
		dedicated to creating meaningful digital products.
	</p>

	<p>
		I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks, particularly React and Astro, and I'm a strong advocate for 
		Tailwind CSS and minimalist design principles. I believe that the best software is not just functional, 
		but also intuitive and delightful to use.
	</p>

	<p>
		Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my 
		knowledge through writing. This site is my personal space to document my learning and showcase the 
		projects I'm most proud of.
	</p>

	<h3>What I'm currently working on:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Building performant static sites with Astro 5.0</li>
		<li>Exploring the latest features in Tailwind CSS 4.0</li>
		<li>Designing user-centric interfaces for complex web apps</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just have a chat about technology and design!
