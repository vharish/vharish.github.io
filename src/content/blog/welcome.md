Welcome to the first post on my new portfolio site! 

I've recently migrated my personal website from an older Jekyll setup to a modern stack using **Astro 5.0** and **Tailwind CSS 4.0**. This change brings significant improvements in performance, developer experience, and design flexibility.

### Why Astro?

Astro is a modern web framework that pulls the best parts of different technologies together. Its "Islands Architecture" allows me to build a highly performant static site while still having the flexibility to add interactive components where needed.

### What to expect

On this blog, I'll be sharing:
- Tutorials on web development.
- Insights into UI/UX design.
- Updates on my personal projects.

Thanks for stopping by!
