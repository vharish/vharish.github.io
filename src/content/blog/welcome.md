Welcome! I'm Harish, and this is where I document my journey as a software engineer and creator. 

After 12 years of building systems at companies like Google and Practo, I've shifted my focus toward independent projects that leverage AI and modular architecture. I created this space to share the high-fidelity lessons I've learned along the way.

### What to expect here:

- **Technical Deep Dives**: Moving beyond "Hello World" to solve real-world architectural problems (like the [Hydration Bottleneck](/blog/data-aware-rule-engines)).
- **AI Exploration**: Practical insights into integrating Neural Networks into deterministic business logic.
- **The Craft of Software**: Thoughts on minimalism, developer experience, and the intersection of technology and design.
- **Beyond the Code**: Occasional diversions into electronic music, nature, and whatever else is fueling my creativity.

Thanks for being here. I hope you find something useful.
